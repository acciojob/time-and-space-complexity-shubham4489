		<h1>Time, Space Complexity</h1>
		<p>Time complexity is the amount of time it takes an algorithm to run, in proportion to the size of the input. It's a measure of how efficiently an algorithm can process data. Time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the asymptotic behavior of an algorithm as the input size increases.</
			<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run to completion. It is typically expressed in terms of the size of the input to the algorithm, and is often expressed using Big O(n) notation.</p>
